Information security policies:::

>NIST CSF
->FRAMEWORK FOR IMPROVING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CYBERSECURITY
->voluntary guidance based on standards, practices


------>Identify
develop the organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data and capabilities

* asset management
* business environment
* governance
* risk assessment
* risk management strategy

+ know your network
	- develop baselines
	- actively monitor your assets
	- byod problems
+ identify your attack surfaces
	- business essentials that introduce vulnerabilities
	- patch cycles that you may not be able to keep up with
	- accepted risk
+ regulations
	- HIPAA
	- PCI-DSS
	- CJCSM 6510.01B

> A-CAT
- A.void risk
- C.ontrol/mitigate risk
- A.ccept risk
- T.ransfer risk


------->protect
develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical infrastructure services


* Access control (PR.AC)
 	- least privilege
 	- separation of duties
 	- rotation of duties
 	- mandatory vacations

* Awareness and training (PR.AT)
	- end users educated to perform duties consistent with related policies
	
* Data Security (PR.DS)
	- secure your security mechanisms

* Information protection processes and procedures (PR.IP)

* Maintenance (PR.MA)

* protective Technology (PR.PT)


------->detect
develop and implement the appropriate activites to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event

import previous stuff



------->respond
develop and implement the appropriate activites to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event

* response planning
	- hot/warm/cold sites

* communications 
	- PR officer
	- law enforcement
	- IT contact
	- Legal rep

* analysis
	- honey pot
	- forensics gathering

* mitigation

* improvements
	- hotwash
	- forensics
	- reverse engineering

* identify two points
	- Determining weaknesses
	- what was breached

* ways to contain an incident
	- block and log unauthorized access
	- restrict  access to malware
	- change passwds
	- some other stuff

------->recover
develop and implement the appropriate activities ot maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event

* Recovery planning
	- backups
	- preserve evidence

* Improvements

* Communications

* Understand legal obligations

* notification process


> UKY's information security policy example



>cheesy video





>life cycle of a breach
->discovery
->investigation
->assemble response team
->contact law enforcement
->employ vendors like forensics, etc
->begin notification process
->mail/email notifications
->respond to inquiries
->resume normality
