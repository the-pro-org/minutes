Passwords and Scanning brought to you by Blaine Timothy Billings.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication

used in military checkpoints

first passwd used in computers in 1961 at MIT

passwds first stored as hashes in 1974



hashes are irreversible
	* compare stored hash to that of the input passwd

	---> /etc/shadow

sometimes stored with a salt or pepper

		salt   - a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that "hashes" data, a password or passphrase

		pepper - a secret added to an input such as a password prior to being hashed with a cryptographic hash function.
				 A pepper performs a similar role to a salt, but while a salt is stored alongside the hashed output, a pepper is not.

adds entropy to hash calculation and protects against some attacks such as rainbow tables



Strong Passwords
-------------------

NIST standards include
 * min of 16 chars
 * allow 64 + chars
 * use pass phrases instead of random characters and substitutions.
 

 > use uncommon words
 > don't give hints
 > limit attempts at login
 > multi-factor authentication
 > secure storage in db
 > no passwd reset
	- more likely to reuse or forget passwd if it's long as heck




Password Attacks
------------------------

 > Brute forcing

	Compare hashes of all possible combinations of character to the hash in question

	easily cracks short passwords

	naive approach

	exponential time complexity for each additional char

	addiitonally must calculate the hash of each generated combination

 > dictionary

	compare hashes of words from a list to the hash in question

		- good dictionaries are usually included in linux at /usr/share/wordlists/
			- rockyou.txt highly recommended

	lower time complexity than brute forcing

	weak to case-matching

	have to calculate hashes as well

	Addtl rules:
		 good against everyday user
		
		allows for variation

		medium time complexity


 > Rainbow Table 

	lists of hashes for common passwords, similar to a dictionary

	good against every day user

	very low time complexity

	passwd must be in the rainbow table
	
	salts and peppers render these useless, since they have to be incorporated into the password and the hash has to be regenerated.



 > Keylogger

	monitors keys pressed by a user

	both hardware and software loggers

	you get the actual passwd

	more difficult to install on a remote system than the above attacks
		- hardware logger requires physicla access
		- AV software is good at recognizing software keyloggers

 > cracking tools

	john the ripper

	hash cat

	hydra

	cain and abel

	davegrohl

	elcomsoft

	aircrack-ng for wifi



 Password Defenses
---------------------------

Bruteforce

	use long passwords

Rainbow tables
	
	use salts and peppers to entropy the hash


Keyloggers
	
	use 2-factor authentication

Social engineering

	don't do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UqEg1cFqig

Scanning & Enumeration
--------------------------
scanning
	determining what the targets are doing
enumeration
	determining what the targets are


ICMP scan ( actually enumeration)

	ping all Ips in the network
	responders are hosts

	detects all hosts in network, but likely to block


ARP scan

	send ARP packets for all IPs in subnet
	responders are hsots

	this is not normally blocked, but only local scanning works
	you can't run a network without ARP

	scanning 10.10.1.X works if you're there, but 10.10.2.X won't work ?



Network scanning

	TCP SYN scan

		send a syn packet to machine at port 

		if port is open, SYN/ACK response

		if closed, RST response

		if no response, assume filtered


		Works quickly, but could be blocked

	

	TCP connection scan

		similar to SYN scan, but maintain connection.

		
		not likely to be blocked, but it's pretty slow since connections are maintained


	UDP ICMP scan

		send a UDP packet to a machine at port

		if open, no response

		if closed, ICMP response


		detects closed ports, but likely to be filtered

	
	Website scanning

		list of common directories and files

		send GET or HEAD requests to such directories

		recursively scan with discovered directories

		essentially bruteforce dictionary attack



Common Tools:

	Network

		nmap and Angry IP Scanner

	
	website

		dirb and dir buster

		wfuzz

		metasploit

			/auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner


backup files typiclaly have more lax security so backup programs can access them.

NCL starting soon !!

You can learn a lot from doing CTFs; always good to put what we talk about in the club meetings into practice

"Don't quote me on this, but the $25 you spend on this will be better than a textbook, because you learn by doing' - Dr. X



All the tools talked about toda yare available in Kali linux. Highly recommended to install on your computer or in a VM. You will definitely use it for NCL
