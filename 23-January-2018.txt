CLI - tcpdump:
 - First '-n' Stops from resolving IP address to host name
 - Second '-n' Checks all the ports coming from packets and matches the port with the service
CLI - cut:
 - Used to extract sections from each line of input

ARP Poisoning:
 - What is it?
 - - ARP Tables map IP to MAC
 - - Spoofing MAC, saying you have the IP of a legitimate user
 - What was in the PCAP?
 - - Three main devices:
 - - - Attacker - Hewlett Packard
 - - - Victim - Dell
 - - - Router - Cisco
 - - Attacker wanted to find victim, and sent an ARP (Packet 54)
 - - Attacker received victim's MAC (Packet 55)
 - - Attacker directly sent ARP to the victim with the "source IP" set as the router's IP (Packet 56)
 - - This way, the victim thinks the attacker is the router
 - - Attacker was just "man-in-the-middling" the outgoing traffic from the victim

Trojan:
 - Background:
 - - SNORT Triggered an alert after seeing Hex for "ANABILGI|"
 - What was in the PCAP?
 - - Two main devices:
 - - - Attacker - Vmware
 - - - Victim - Hewlett Packard
 - - On packets 4, 5, 10, 32, 156, 280, 405, 531, and 652 we can see the hex
 - - "tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0" Gets first packet of every TCP conversation
